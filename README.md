# Web3 DevBox
This container is meant to serve as a development environment for web3 applications.

Comes with:
- node version 16.14.0
- yarn
- python3
- build-essential
- vim
- openjdk-8

I have used with projects:
- scaffold-eth
- status-im

## Why did I make this?
To save space on my mac.

XCode is a pain to work with and takes up so much space.
Without it I can't use brew or do anything useful and
Docker came to save the day.
